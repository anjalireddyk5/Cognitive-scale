# Cognitive-scale

Cognitive Clouds are the next evolution of cloud computing. They are a new class of data interpretation and learning systems that weave insights and advice into the fabric of business and daily life. They fuse different data types (text, tweets, blogs, images, videos) on a massive scale and make sense of our increasingly interconnected and amazingly complex world. Partners in the Cognitive Clouds include IBM Watson, IBM Bluemix, Deloitte, Avention and Amazon web services.
